# Tesla-stock-market-price-prediction-using-neural-networks
This project will contain a basic code of how to use neutral network model and on stock prices and make prediction of the future stock market value using the ARIMA model.
Objective:  

The primary objective of this project is to predict the future stock prices of Tesla Inc., one of the world’s most influential electric vehicle and clean energy companies. The project aims to leverage historical stock price data and apply advanced machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions. 

 

Methods:  

The project will employ a combination of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models and Neural Networks, two powerful techniques for time series forecasting. ARIMA models are particularly well-suited for data showing evidence of non-stationarity, while Neural Networks can model complex non-linear patterns. 

 

Data: The dataset comprises daily Tesla stock prices, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume, from June 2010 onwards. The data will be normalized to ensure optimal performance of the models. 

 

Procedure: 

 The data will be split into training and testing sets. An ARIMA model will be fitted to the training data, and its performance will be evaluated on the testing data. Similarly, a Neural Network will be trained on the same data. The models’ predictions will be compared to actual values to assess their accuracy. The models will then be used to forecast future stock prices. 

 

 

Expected Outcomes:  

This project expects to develop a reliable model for predicting Tesla’s future stock prices. While it’s understood that stock price prediction is inherently uncertain and should be approached with caution, the project aims to provide a data-driven perspective on future trends.
